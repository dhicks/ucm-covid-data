# Auto-scraped archive of the UC Merced Covid Testing and Positivity Statistics  #

This repository contains code and resulting data for scraping and archiving the Testing and Positivity Statistics table on [UC Merced's Covid dashboards page](https://doyourpart.ucmerced.edu/covid-19-statistics).  

The code runs on my personal machine every morning at 7:45am (assuming it's active, which is usually the case).  If new data is detected, the shell script automatically adds, commits, and pushes it up to this repo.
